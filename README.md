Create a simple numeric to alpha code class SimpleCode that takes a set of numbers and turns them into words and sentences.  The code should use the 0 to represent a space between words and 00 to represent a period at the end of a sentence.  The 26 letters of the alphabet should be represented in reverse order.  In other words, Z is 1 and A is 26. You may choose any delimiter that you like.  In your final product, only the first letter of a sentence should be capitalized.  Hint:  StringBuilder might be useful as well as a set of parallel arrays or perhaps Enums.
You should use JOptionPane for your interactions with users.
Please make sure you comment your code thoroughly.
The code should be nicely formatted and should use proper variables.
You will post a link to your video here.
The vide should have the following items:
1) You should start by showing the comments in your code that include your name, the class, and what the assignment is.
2) You should show all of your code. Slowly scroll through your code.
3) You must show your code compiling.
4) You must show your code running and completely test your program. If there are special inputs or outputs your program should check, please make sure you detail that your program can handle it.
5) If there is anything special you added to the program then please detail it.
6) Make sure to include all source files with your submission.
You only have 5 minutes in your screen cast so please make sure you are concise and you cover everything you need. You may have to practice your screen capturing a few times to get this right.
